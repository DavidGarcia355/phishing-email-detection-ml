# Phishing Email Detection with Machine Learning

This project applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to detect phishing emails.  
Developed as part of a team project at Purdue University Northwest.

---

## Project Overview
- Built and trained a **Logistic Regression classifier** on a dataset of ~82,000 labeled phishing and legitimate emails (Kaggle).  
- Preprocessed text using:
  - Regex cleanup  
  - Stopword removal  
  - TF-IDF vectorization  
- Evaluated model with precision, recall, and accuracy.  

---

## Results
- Achieved **98% overall accuracy**  
- Precision & Recall for phishing detection: **0.99**  
- Demonstrated that Logistic Regression, paired with proper preprocessing, is effective for phishing detection with low false positives.

---

## Tools Used
- **Python** (scikit-learn, pandas, nltk)  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Kaggle Dataset (~82k emails)**
